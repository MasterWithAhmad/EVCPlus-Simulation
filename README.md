# EVC Plus Simulation

Welcome to the **EVC Plus Simulation**! This project simulates the EVC Plus system, replicating the features of the real-world EVC Plus application. Built with Node.js, this simulation allows users to perform various financial transactions, including money transfers and airtime recharges, all secured by a PIN-based system.

## Features

- **User   Registration**: Easily register using your phone number and a secure PIN.
- **Money Transfers**: Transfer funds to other registered users by selecting their number and entering your PIN.
- **Airtime Recharge**: Recharge airtime for yourself or others by selecting a phone number and entering your PIN.
- **PIN Security**: All transactions (money transfers and airtime recharges) require PIN verification for added security.
- **Transaction Limits**: Prevents users from transferring more than their available balance, ensuring safe transactions.
- **User   Interface**: Console-based interface for straightforward user interactions.
